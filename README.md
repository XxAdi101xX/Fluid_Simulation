TODO: 
- Implement position predictions for particles to reduce initial chaos and have it settle to a stable state quicker.
- Change color of particles based on velocity to visualize speed.
- Drastically improve performance by using spatial partitioning (e.g., grid or octree) to reduce the number of particle interactions.
- Improve performance by implementing instancing, eg. look into using UInstancedStaticMeshComponent for rendering particles
